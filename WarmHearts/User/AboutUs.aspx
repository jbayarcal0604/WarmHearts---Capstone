                         It all started with a random letter. Several of those were joined forces to create a random word. 
                        The words decided to get together and form a random sentence. They decided not to stop there and it wasn't long before a random paragraph had been cobbled together. 
                        The question was whether or not they could continue the momentum long enough to create a random short story.
